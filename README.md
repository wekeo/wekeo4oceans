# Welcome to WEkEO4Oceans

**wekeo4oceans** is a repository of Python based tools to introduce you to atmospheric data on the [WEkEO DIAS (Data Information
and Access System)](https://wekeo.eu/) and its Jupyter Lab. The content includes notebooks explaining WEkEO and the Jupyter Lab environment and
how to use the Harmonised Data Access (HDA) API that is fundamental to WEkEO. Within this repository are 
tutorials and case studies, using data from the Copernicus Programme that are available on WEkEO and written by expert trainers
from Mercator Ocean International, ECMWF and EUMETSAT.

The content provided is mostly based on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which allow
a high-level of interactive learning, as code, text description and visualisation 
is combined in one place.

## Copernicus Data

The notebooks contained within the repository feature data from the OLCI, SLSTR and SRAL sensors aboard the Sentinel-3 satellite.


## Where to find what you need

The content of this repository is suitable for those completely new to WEkEO, Python, Copernicus data
and hosted processing environments.

Below is a summary of the files provided, with recommendations on where to start:

## How to use this material

If you are on GitHub/Lab you can visit www.wekeo.eu, register for an account and enter the JupyterLab - then follow the instructions below. 

If you are currently on the WEkEO JupyterLab you're already in the right place and can start. To clone this repository in to the WEkEO JupyterLab environment open a terminal in the WEkEO JupyterLab, type 
  > `cd work`<br>
  > `git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/wekeo/wekeo4oceans.git`<br> 
 
 This will create a clone of this repository of notebooks in the work directory on your Jupyterlab instance. You can use the same command to clone any external repository you like.

You can also use this code on your own computer/Jupyter Lab server, however you won't have the fast access provided by the Harmonized Data Access as part of the WEkEO infrastructure.


### Recommended python set up

This repository supports Python 3.7. We highly recommend that users working on their own systems install the appropriate Anaconda distribution for their operating system. Here is a link to the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Python environments

Python allows users to create specific environments that suit their applications. 
This tutorials included in this collection require a number of non-standard 
packages - by which we refer to those no included by default in Anaconda. These are included in the JupyterLab environment but you may need to install them for local working.
